# Pomodoro-Study-Timer
 
This Flutter timer application is based on the Pomodoro time management technique which attempts to divide work into intervals of 25 minutes (traditionally) with short pauses or breaks in between. 
The application consists of two timers, one for the studying time (25 minutes) and another for taking a break (5 minutes). The flutter percent indicator package has been used to display the progress of the timers.
